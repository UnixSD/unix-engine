# About 
(Conceived and initially implemented by Unget343)
The game engine is designed for game development, with its own UxFrame framework, allowing you to easily create 2D and 3D games using OpenGL. It is crossplatform because it uses Qt components, but there are libraries that use Xlib to implement functionality. 

# Build
You can use Qmake(because it uses Qt components) for compilation, but if you don't have it or need Cmake, you can download the version you need from the "Release" section.

# features 
- Originally designed for 3D games
- Convenient framework for C++ development
- The framework can be used outside of the game engine
